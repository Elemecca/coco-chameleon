# CoCo Chameleon

The CoCo Chameleon is a cartridge for the Tandy TRS-80 Color Computer
line of home computers from the 1980s which emulates other cartridges.
It supports all three versions of the CoCo and should be able to
replicate the computer-facing behavior of nearly any other cartridge.

The primary aim of the project is to emulate ROM cartridges and all
of the common floppy and hard disk controller cartridges from image
files stored on a MicroSD card.
